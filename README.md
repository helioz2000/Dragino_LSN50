LoRa STM32 Source Code, repackaged to build with STM32CubeIDE
=============================================================
This is a copy of the repository [LoRa_STM32](https://github.com/dragino/LoRa_STM32) from Dragino. 
The repository contains the sources to build a sample LoRa application for their [LSN50](http://www.dragino.com/products/lora/item/128-lsn50.html) and [LSN50-v2](https://www.dragino.com/products/lora-lorawan-end-node/item/155-lsn50-v2.html).
The code itself is unmodified, whereas I have added project defintions and settings to build with STM32CubeIDE.
I have tested this with the LSN50-v2 and STM32CubeIDE 1.8.
In order to import the project, open STM32CubeIDE, then select File -> Open Projects from File System and adjust the path for "Import Source" to the repo directory.

V1.7.2 by Christophe

Define Target Device:
=====================
inc/hw_conf contains definition for target board, either LSN50 sensor node or LoRa ST Module


To change LoRa region:
======================
REGION_AU915 definition in Menu->Project->Properties->C/C++Build->Settings->MCU GCC Compiler->Preprocessor
remember to change for both Debug and Release
